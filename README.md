# Project Description:

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major medical problem and can be cured if treated it in the
early stages. Usually, people are not aware that medical tests, we take for different purposes
could contain valuable information concerning kidney diseases. Consequently, attributes of
various medical tests are investigated to distinguish which attributes may contain helpful
information about the disease.The information says that it helps us to measure the severity
of the problem, the predicted survival of the patient after the illness, the pattern of the disease
and work for curing the disease.

# Solution:

In this proposed system we are able to identify the patients with disease. Once any person gets kidney disease, 
they may suffer from the disease which may decrease their working capability as well as living quality. 
Our aim is to predict patients with chronic kidney failure (ckd) disease and patients who do not (notckd) suffer from the disease. 
So for that we are building a Machine Learning model to predict the compressive strength of concrete using IBM Watson AutoAI Machine Learning Service.
The model is deployed on IBM cloud to get scoring end point which can be used as API in mobile app or web app building. 
We are developing a web application which is built using node red service. We make use of the scoring end point to give user input values to the deployed model.
The model prediction is then showcased on User Interface.
